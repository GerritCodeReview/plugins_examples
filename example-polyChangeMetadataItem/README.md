# PolyGerrit Add widget to changeView left panel

## How to install

There is nothing to build, just copy the gerrit-change-metadataItem.html into
the Gerrit's /plugins directory. There is no need to restart anything,
once the file gets copied, Gerrit will detect the new PolyGerrit plugin after
a few moments.
