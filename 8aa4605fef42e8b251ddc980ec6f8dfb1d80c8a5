I\u0027m curious about his opinion on that, but I would tend to disagree on that. Bazel is our official build tool, and I would avoid to officially support anything else on master.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think you can equate a plugin\u0027s master branch with gerrit\u0027s master branch.  I think this example plugin will have value for many past versions of gerrit, it is not meant to just service the tip of gerrit master.  What is your primary concern?  Are you concerned that this will be a maintenance problem, and that you will need to support buck on master?  I think that if we support buck here, it would be with the understanding that this is only be intended for use with older gerrit versions where buck works, and that this does not mean that we would be expected to support buck in general.  Is your concern that we just shouldn\u0027t be providing examples of how to use buck, and that people might copy the buck configs into their new plugins?",

      "message": "I would like to aim to shutdown the cookbook plugin soon.  To do that, I want to be considerate and ensure that we support what we did for that plugin so that there is no reason to not be able to shut that plugin down!  Keeping buck support for the examples extracted from there feels like the right thing to do to further that objective.  I think creating a stable-2.13 branch once we have achieved that might make a lot of sense (if we feel that is needed).\n\nI also think that if we merge new code here, it should at least be expected to support bazel, so this change supports both.  Any buck support on new examples is just a bonus until we branch.  But I would expect new examples to only have to support bazel.",
